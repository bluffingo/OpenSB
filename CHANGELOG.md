## Beta 2.0.x (October 2021-March 2022)
TL:DR: Finalium was finalized with new CSS, codebase became bloated, and the last version, Beta 2.0.9, introduced a layout so broken that it nearly caused a full-on rewrite (which later became pokTwo).
# Beta 1.x (July 2021 - October 2021)
## Beta 1.9 (October 9th 2021)
TL:DR: Bootstrap-based Finalium introduced, early prototypical implementation of artwork and music systems.
## Beta 1.1 (August 13th 2021)
TL:DR: Licensed to AGPL, Chinese translation (later removed as they were unmaintained),.
## Beta 1.0 (July 31st 2021)
TL:DR: Removed pre-Finalium implementation of sbNext, replaced player, Bootstrap theme was changed to "Finalium" (not to be confused with sbNext Finalium, the 2022 frontend).
## Pre-Beta (July 17th 2021)
TL:DR: Subscriptions, that's it.
## Pre-Beta Preview (July 16th 2021)
TL:DR: 404 redesign (which I don't think was functional), new login/register pages.
# squareBracket Alpha (April 2021 - July 2021)
## Alpha 3 Refresh (July 12th 2021)
TL:DR: Development on Pre-Finalium sbNext begins and new API.
## Alpha 3 (June 28th 2021)
TL:DR: Altered template system for the ability to add multiple frontends, Bootstrap 5 theme tweaks.
## Alpha 2 Refresh (May 27th 2021)
TL:DR: Localization, bad design decisions.
## Alpha 2 Refresh Preview (May 15th 2021)
TL:DR: SCSS vulnerability fix?
## Alpha 2 (May 13th 2021)
TL:DR: Profiles were redone? I honestly don't know.
## Alpha 1 (May 8th 2021)
* Basic functionality
* New codebase for very major security reasons
# PokTube (January 2021-April 2021)
TL:DR: Différent codebase, SQL injections vulns everywhere.
