# Qobo Upload Guidelines (draft, 10/21/2023, last edited by Bluffingo)

## Videos
* Only upload videos created by you. We will take down any reuploads of videos clearly not done by you. (This does not apply to video submissions uploaded prior to April 2023)
* * Modifying the copyrighted material to be parodic (akin to a YTP) or a "remix" should be fine, but you must not use automatic tools (VEG replaces for example).

## Images/Artwork
* Fan-art depicting copyrighted characters are allowed.
* It is forbidden to upload images done using any kind of AI, even partially.
* Images that are traced off someone else's image are not allowed.
* Do not reupload any images not created by you.
* You are allowed to upload anything made **for you** that's a result of a gift/commission/trade/YCH (Your Character Here), However, you must get permission and are required to credit whoever made it, and preferably link to the original, even if it's not on Qobo.
* * An exception is allowed regarding linking the original from outside Qobo if the author doesn't allow guests to view that submission.

## Content ratings
Note that your submission may be viewed by less users if your rating is higher. ***This is not to be confused with the star-rating system***

In order to see Questionable and Mature content, you ***must*** have be logged in and change your "Comfortable Ratings" setting in your Settings page.

### General
(Please note that content intended for children is forbidden)

General-rated submissions should NOT have any use/reference to fetishes or any stuff deemed inappropriate.

### Questionable
Questionable-rated submissions have more freedom to include most forms of inappropriate content. However, you must not depict anything sexual (being turned on, sexual pleasure, etc.).

### Mature
This rating should be used for submissions that are either ***completely*** sexual in nature or include nudity. 

However, please note that Qobo is not intended to be a porn site. As such, we ***forbid*** any real-life videos and photos.

## What we don't allow
This list is kept short.

* Anything not deemed suitable to advertisers.
* Mature-rated content featuring minors (***INCLUDING FICTIONAL***)
* "Morally incorrect" content (gore, deaths, abuse, rape)
* Extremely edgy/Politically incorrect content ("Moonman", Nazi symbols, racist jokes)
