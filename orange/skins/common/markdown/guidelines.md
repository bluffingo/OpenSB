# Qobo Upload Guidelines (draft, 10/6/2023, last edited by Bluffingo)

## Videos
* Only upload videos created by you. We will take down any reuploads of videos clearly not done by you. (This does not apply to video submissions uploaded prior to April 2023)
* * Modifying the copyrighted material to be parodic (akin to a YTP) or a "remix" should be fine.
* * * However, if the modifications are done automatically using the help of a template (example: VEG replaced sparta remixes), it is not allowed.
## Images/Artwork
* Fan-art depicting copyrighted characters are allowed.
* It is forbidden to upload images done using any kind of AI, even partially.
* Images that are traced off someone else's image are not allowed.
* Do not reupload any images not created by you.
* You are allowed to upload anything made **for you** that's a result of a gift/commission/trade/YCH (Your Character Here), However, you must get permission and are required to credit whoever made it, and preferably link to the original, even if it's not on Qobo.
* * An exception is allowed regarding linking the original from outside Qobo if the author doesn't allow guests to view that submission.

## Content ratings
This functionality is currently not available on Qobo due to advertising.

This list is kept short.

* Anything not deemed suitable to advertisers.
* Any fetish-y content. (scat, vore, diapers, etc.)
* Inappropriate content featuring minors (including loli and cub)
* "Not safe for life" content (gore, deaths, abuse)
