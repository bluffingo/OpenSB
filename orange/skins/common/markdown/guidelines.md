# Qobo Upload Guidelines (draft, 9/9/2023, last edited by Chaziz)
These are not final, and will be subject to change.

## Videos
* Only upload videos created by you. We will take down any reuploads of videos clearly not done by you. (This does not apply to video submissions uploaded prior to April 2023)
* * Modifying the copyrighted material to be parodic (akin to a YTP) or a "remix" should be fine.
* * * However, if the modifications are done automatically using the help of a template (example: VEG replaced sparta remixes), it is not allowed.
## Images/Artwork
* Fan-art depicting copyrighted characters are allowed.
* It is forbidden to upload images done using any form of AI, even partially.
* Images that are traced off someone else's image are not allowed.
* Do not reupload any images not created by you.
* You are allowed to upload anything made **for you** that's a result of a gift/commission/trade/YCH (Your Character Here), However, you must get permission and are required to credit whoever made it, and preferably link to the original, even if it's not on Qobo.
* * An exception is allowed regarding linking the original from outside Qobo if the author doesn't allow guests to view that submission.

## Content ratings
**THIS MAY CHANGE DUE TO ADVERTISING**
* Despite there being options to set your submission to Questionable and Mature when uploading, we recommend waiting after "New Qobo" is finished, as filtering such content is not available on "Production Qobo" (running openSB Beta 3.1)

## What we don't allow
This list is kept short.

* Fetishes that's often seen as being gross (scat, vore, diapers, etc.)
* Inappropriate content featuring minors (including loli and cub)
* "Not safe for life" content (gore, deaths, abuse)
* Extremely "edgy" content ("moonman", nazi symbols, racist jokes)
