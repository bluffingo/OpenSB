# Betty Framework
The Betty framework aims to modernize the openSB backend.
## Why...
### ...is this a thing?
The openSB backend is a little bit difficult to maintain, with it being somewhat glued a bit too much with the frontend. It also still has bugs/quirks that have been there since the beginning of development.

### ...not use Symfony or Laravel for openSB?
Using Symfony *components* will work, but the Symfony *framework* would require a rewrite of openSB. Using Laravel would also require a full rewrite of openSB, given the way Laravel works.

### ...is this not licensed under something like MIT?
Because openSB is licensed under AGPL 3.0. openSB's roots come from an AGPL 3.0-licensed project called principia-web.
