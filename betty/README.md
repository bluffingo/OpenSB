# Betty Framework
The Betty framework aims to modernize the openSB backend.
## Why is this a thing?
The openSB backend is a little bit difficult to maintain, with it being somewhat glued a bit too much with the frontend. It also still has bugs/quirks that have been there since the beginning of development.
