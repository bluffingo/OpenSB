# OpenSB Orange
![Screen Shot 2023-12-08 at 21 55 07](https://github.com/qobotv/OpenSB/assets/45898787/e7f0837c-ff8a-4b5c-b7fa-630131bc1507)

## How to setup an OpenSB instance.

1. Get an Apache server with PHP and MariaDB up and running, including Composer and the PHP GD library extension. NGINX/FreeNGINX should work, but we use Apache on Qobo production.
1. Setup a virtual host. Look below the steps for an example.
1. Run `composer update` from the terminal.
1. Copy `config.sample.php`, rename it to `config.php` and fill in your database credentials.
1. Import the database template found in `sql/` into the database you want to use.
1. Run the `compile-scss` script available in the tools directory to generate the required stylesheets. You may find Dart-Sass here at https://sass-lang.com/install/.
### Production specific

1. Instead of installing dependencies using `composer update` you do `composer update --no-dev`
1. Make the `dynamic/` and `templates/cache/` directories writable by your web server.
1. Modify `$branding` to replace openSB branding with your custom branding. Check the `public/assets/placeholder` directory for reference.

### Development specific

1. Disable Twig's template caching by setting `$tplNoCache` to true.
1. Enable debugging features by setting `$isDebug` to true.
1. If you want to be able to upload during development, make the `dynamic/` directory and the directories inside it writable by your web server.

### Virtual host example
You will have to modify the directories to match your instance's location.
```
<VirtualHost *> 
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/openSB/public"

    Alias /dynamic "C:/xampp/openSB/dynamic"

    <Directory "C:/xampp/openSB">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

## Questions

### Why do I get 404 errors when I click on thumbnails?

Assuming you use Apache and have the rewrite module installed, this is because AllowOverride is turned off. See the virtual host example above for a quick fix.

### Is this related to Kylarz's squareBracket?
No. Kylarz's squareBracket uses a closed-source "TicTac" backend and is not affiliated with us. The original squareBracket (by Bluffingo) was renamed to Qobo in the latter half of 2022, and still uses OpenSB.
