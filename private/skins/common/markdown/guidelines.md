# squareBracket Upload Guidelines 
Last updated by Chaziz on June 9th 2024.

## What we don't allow
**If you upload anything that falls under this list, your accounts will most likely be terminated.**

* Content intended for children. We are not babysitters.
* Illegal pornographic content (CSAM/CSEM, bestiality).
* Shock content (Real or realistic gore, deaths).
* Non-consenting content (Rape, leaking personal information).
* Edgy content (Nazism, racism, bigotry).

## Videos
* Only upload videos that you have created yourself. Any reuploads of videos not made by you will be taken down. However, an exception is made for memes and content in the public domain. This does not apply to squareBracket submissions uploaded before April 2023.
* Parody edits of copyrighted material (known as YTPs) are allowed unless if the original copyright authors aren't fine with it.

## Images
### Artwork
* Fan-art featuring copyrighted characters is permitted.
* Tracing from someone else's artwork is not allowed.
* Only upload artwork that you have created. Do not reupload artwork created by others.
* You can upload artwork made for you as a gift, commission, trade, or YCH, but you need permission, must credit the creator, and preferably provide a link to the original.
## Photos
* It is forbidden to upload any artificially generated photos.

## Sensitive content
Originally known as content ratings (not to be confused with the 5-star ratings), this has been replaced with one simple setting.

Here are the differences between both options:

* General: All users can see general content. This type of content is suitable for all audiences and contains no references to inappropriate material.
* Sensitive: Users who enable this setting can view content that includes inappropriate content.
