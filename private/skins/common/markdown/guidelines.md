Last edited by Bluffingo on February 16th 2024.

## What we don't allow
**If you upload anything that falls under this list, your accounts will most likely be terminated.**

* Content intended for children. We are not babysitters.
* Mature-rated submissions depicting/featuring minors, real or not. Even if it's like a thousand years old and yet it looks like a child, we won't allow it.
* Shock content (Real gore, people dying).
* Non-consenting content (Rape, leaking personal information).
* Edgy, politically-incorrect content (Nazism, racism, bigotry).

## Videos
* Only upload videos that you have created yourself. Any reuploads of videos not made by you will be taken down. However, an exception is made for memes and content in the public domain. This does not apply to Qobo submissions uploaded before April 2023.
* Parody edits of copyrighted material (known as YTPs) are allowed.
* Videos produced using AI, akin to OpenAI's Sora, are not allowed.

## Images and drawings
* Fan-art featuring copyrighted characters is permitted.
* It is forbidden to upload images generated using AI, except for drawings made using an AI-generated image as a reference.
* Tracing images from someone else's work is not allowed.
* Only upload images that you have created. Do not reupload images created by others.
* You can upload content made for you as a gift, commission, trade, or YCH, but you need permission, must credit the creator, and preferably provide a link to the original. An exception is allowed if the original submission cannot be linked if it's site requires an account to access it.

## Content ratings
Note that your submission will be seen by fewer people if it's content rating is higher. This is not to be confused with the star-rating system.

In order to view Questionable and Mature content on Qobo, you must be logged in and change your "Comfortable Rating" setting in your Settings page.

### General rating
* General submissions should not have any references or depictions to fetishes and inappropriate content.

### Questionable rating
* Questionable submissions can have references/depictions to fetishes and inappropriate content.
* Questionable submissions must not depict sexual situations (sexual pleasure, horniness).

### Mature rating
* Mature submissions can have references/depictions to sexual situations and nudity.
* Real-life videos and photos are not allowed.
