# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for this site, SquareBracket (alternatively known as FulpTube).

The only person who currently has full server and database access is Chaziz, who is the server administrator. Moderators do not have full server or database access and can only use moderation tools provided by Chaziz.

Currently, SquareBracket is hosted on a server provided by Endless Hosting in the United States. Backups are stored by Chaziz in Canada.

Whenever a request is sent, it is logged in the server's access logs. This will include your IP, user agent and HTTP referer. These access logs are only accessible to the server administrators. They will be used for temporary statistics and for logging potential errors that occur. In the case of illegal activity (e.g. a DDoS attack) the offending parts of an access log may be saved for further analysis.

This site consists mainly of user generated content, and whenever you e.g. upload a submission or write a comment you should be aware that this content will be publicly available and searchable on the Internet.

## User information
When you register an account, you provide a username, email and password. The username is visible and should not be your real name, but a pseudonym you are comfortable with others seeing.

The password you register with is one-way hashed with bcrypt and the hash is only visible to the server admin, who cannot convert this back into the original password.

Whenever you are logged in, your latest IP address is stored in the database (independent of access logs). This is only visible to the server administrator and is kept strictly private unless abuse occurs.

Any additional user information you add to your profile (Profile description, etc.) is strictly optional and will be displayed publicly on your user page, do not put private or otherwise personal information you do not want accessible on the internet.

## Cookies
This site uses a session cookie (`sb_session`) to keep you logged in, this cookie should not be publicly disclosed to *anyone* as it will make them able to log into your account.

## Removal Requests
If you have published personal information you would like to remove, use the tools given to edit it out if applicable. If this is not possible (e.g. you want to rename a personally identifiable username) or you would like to fully erase it, please contact Chaziz.

## Transparency
SquareBracket runs on OpenSB, which is fully open source and its source code [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/Bluffingo/OpenSB). You may inspect the source code yourself to see how your data is handled by the software.

## Updates
Updates to this privacy policy are done as commits to the OpenSB Git repository ([View changes](https://github.com/Bluffingo/OpenSB/blob/main/private/skins/common/markdown/privacy_policy.md)). You will be alerted of any substantial changes made to the privacy policy through the SquareBracket website.
