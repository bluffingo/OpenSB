# finalium
squareBracket SCSS, made because we had pain and suffering with Bootstrap 5

We (or just Gamerappa) are trying to achieve compatibility with Bootstrap 3's syntax, so converting BS3 pages to Finalium should be easy in the future.

Shit's incomplete as it is still made for squareBracket in mind.
